# Health-Care-Project-ML-Project
In this project we have to perform data analysis &amp; model prediction of Health Care (Cardiovascular diseases). And asked to utilize data wrangling techniques to understand the pattern in the data and visualize the other types of factors affecting CVD and predicting the model with some Machine Learning Algorithm .
In this project we have to perform data analysis & model prediction of Health Care (Cardiovascular diseases). And asked to utilize data wrangling techniques to understand the pattern in the data and visualize the other types of factors affecting CVD and predicting the model with some Machine Learning Algorithm .
Following steps should perform on the data set 
1.	Preliminary analysis:
a.	Perform preliminary data inspection and report the findings on the structure of the data, missing values, duplicates, etc.
b.	Based on these findings, remove duplicates (if any) and treat missing values using an appropriate strategy
2.	Prepare a report about the data explaining the distribution of the disease and the related factors using the steps listed below:
a.	Get a preliminary statistical summary of the data and explore the measures of central tendencies and spread of the data
b.	Identify the data variables which are categorical and describe and explore these variables using the appropriate tools, such as count plot 
c.	Study the occurrence of CVD across the Age category
d.	Study the composition of all patients with respect to the Sex category
e.	Study if one can detect heart attacks based on anomalies in the resting blood pressure (trestbps) of a patient
f.	Describe the relationship between cholesterol levels and a target variable
g.	State what relationship exists between peak exercising and the occurrence of a heart attack
h.	Check if thalassemia is a major cause of CVD
i.	List how the other factors determine the occurrence of CVD
j.	Use a pair plot to understand the relationship between all the given variables
3.	Build a baseline model to predict the risk of a heart attack using a logistic regression and random forest and explore the results while using correlation analysis and logistic regression (leveraging standard error and p-values from statsmodels ) for feature selection
In Solution of above problem I have been performed some EDA and other steps.
•	I have Checked Rows and Column which have null values.
•	I have plot some graph using the help of matplotlib, Seaborn.
•	I have used various types of charts like (histoplot,scatterplot,pie,distplot,countplot).
•	I have made 2 model for prediction (1 Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
•	I have checking the accuracy and other score as well to judge our model for correct prediction 
•	I have created confusion matrix for correct prediction
•	With use of Correlation to obtain the feature selection, to check the prediction with new data .
•	I have performed mean Squared error for logistic regression error.
•	I have import stats model for Logistic Regression Results for gaining the summary and other values.
